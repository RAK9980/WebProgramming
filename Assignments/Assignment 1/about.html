            <h2>Rayyan Ahmed Khokhar</h2>
            <h3>Introduction - Highschool</h3>
            <p>I was born on 2nd June 1994, in a city in Pakistan called Gujranwala, which 
            is a part of the Punjab area in Pakistan. I barely remember my time spent in Pakistan
            as when I was just around the age of 6, my family moved to the UAE, in order to live
            a better life. Most of my childhood that I can remember is from the time I spent growing 
            up in the UAE. I completed my primary school from Leens School and then my middle school 
            till O level, that's 10th grade, from Sherwood Academy and then I completed the rest of 
            my highschool and also graduated from Al Nahda National School. After which, I got admission
            in a Medical university in UAE. However, I decided to not continue studying medicine as I 
            suspected that it was not something that I could do.

            <h3>University - Present</h3>
            <p>
                After leaving my medical study I had some time before I could apply to another
                undergraduate field, during this time I took a 2-3 month course on 3D animation 
                and design, which I really enjoyed and it also lead me to apply for an undergraduate 
                program in Media Technology, thinking that I could further increase my knowledge of 
                animation and design, however just before my main courses were to start I was informed that
                this program had been cancelled due to low interest from students, as such I had to choose 
                another program to continue and end my undergrad. With my choices only being business or IT,
                I choose to go for IT network and security, which I continued studying and was expeected to 
                complete graduate in 2019. Howver, due to various reasons and issues, we decided to move to
                Canada, as such I had to leave my then final year of undergrad and transfer to another univerisyt
                in Canada to continue and finish my studies. I was finally admitted to UOIT in late 2019 to a similar
                program as my previous one in UAE, however, due to university rules I was only given a maximum of 8-9
                courses that transferred, as such I had to basically start my undergrad again in Canada, which 
                I am currently in the process of. As of now I have another 1.5 years before I can graduate.
