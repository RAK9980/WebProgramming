        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <aside>
            <p>Though I have had projects for most of my courses, these two are the ones that I 
                could most recently remember doing.

            <h3>Report on the entertainment industry in Oshawa</h3>
            <p>This was a research report done for my course Business Communication. In which
                our team had to research about the lack of entertainment industry in Oshawa, 
                while comparing it to other popular cities and offer the city solutions on how to
                improve their current situation. We had to present the report as a recording since
                our class was being held online.

            <h3>An overview of the Xbox 360</h3>
            <p>
                This was also another research report done for my course Computer Architecture. 
                In which I had to research about the Xbox 360, since it's developement, it's run in 
                the industry and it's final days and end before the next generation console was 
                released. Again I had to prepare a presentation video for this report as this was 
                also an online class.
